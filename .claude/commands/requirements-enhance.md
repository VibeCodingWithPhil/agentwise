## Example Inputs

**JSON Requirements File:**
```json
{
  "title": "Task Management App",
  "features": [
    {"name": "User Authentication", "priority": "high"},
    {"name": "Task Creation", "priority": "high"},
    {"name": "Task Assignment", "priority": "medium"}
  ],
  "techStack": {
    "frontend": {"framework": "React"},
    "backend": {"framework": "Express.js"}
  }
}
```

**Requirements Description:**
```
Current requirements include basic user management, task creation and assignment, simple reporting. Using React frontend with Node.js backend and PostgreSQL database. Need to add enterprise features and improve security.
```

## Output

Enhanced requirements will include:

1. **Added Features** - New features with justification
2. **Improved Specifications** - Enhanced existing features
3. **Technology Upgrades** - Better tech stack recommendations
4. **Architecture Improvements** - Design pattern enhancements
5. **Implementation Guidance** - How to implement enhancements
6. **Impact Analysis** - Timeline, cost, and complexity impact
7. **Prioritization** - Which enhancements to implement first
8. **Migration Strategy** - How to upgrade existing systems

## Best Practices

- **Incremental Enhancement** - Suggest manageable improvements
- **Backward Compatibility** - Maintain existing functionality
- **Risk Assessment** - Evaluate enhancement risks
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis** - Show value of each enhancement
- **Implementation Roadmap** - Phased enhancement approach

## Related Commands

- `requirements` - Generate initial requirements
- `requirements-visualize` - Create visual specs of enhanced requirements
- `requirements-to-tasks` - Convert enhanced requirements to tasks
- `requirements-validate` - Validate enhanced requirements quality

## Tips for Better Enhancement Results

1. **Be Specific** - Clearly state what areas need improvement
2. **Provide Context** - Include current pain points and limitations
3. **Set Priorities** - Indicate which enhancements are most important
4. **Consider Constraints** - Mention budget, timeline, and team limitations
5. **Think Long-term** - Consider future growth and scalability needs

The enhancement process is iterative - you can enhance requirements multiple times as your project evolves!
