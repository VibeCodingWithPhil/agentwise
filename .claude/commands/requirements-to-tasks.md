## Examples

**Agile Sprint Planning:**
```
Convert my e-commerce requirements into user stories and tasks for 2-week sprints. Team of 5 developers (3 backend, 2 frontend).
```

```

**Enterprise Team Structure:**
```
Generate tasks for a large enterprise team with specialized roles: frontend team, backend team, DevOps, QA, and architects.
```

**MVP-Focused Breakdown:**
```
Create tasks for MVP development first, then enhancement phases. Focus on fastest time-to-market with core features.
```
