# Security Policy

## 🔒 Repository Protection

This repository is protected against malicious contributions through multiple layers of security:

### 1. Branch Protection Rules
- **Main branch is protected**: No direct pushes allowed
- **Pull requests required**: All changes must go through PR review
- **Code owner reviews**: Critical files require owner approval
- **No force pushes**: History cannot be rewritten
- **No deletions**: Branch cannot be deleted

### 2. CODEOWNERS File
Protected directories and files that require owner approval:
- `/.github/` - All GitHub configurations
- `/src/core/` - Core system files
- `/src/orchestrator/` - Critical orchestration logic
- `/.claude/` - Agent configurations
- `/config/` - System configurations
- Root configuration files

### 3. Automated Security Checks
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis
- Sensitive data detection
- Large file deletion prevention

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### Do NOT:
- Create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities
- Share vulnerability details in discussions or comments
- Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities

### Do:
1. **Email privately**: vibephilcoding@gmail.com
2. **Include**:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. **Wait for response**: We'll acknowledge within 48 hours

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Never Commit:
- API keys or tokens
- Passwords or credentials
- Private keys or certificates
- `.env` files with real values
- Personal information
- Internal URLs or endpoints

### Always:
- Review your code for sensitive data before committing
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Report suspicious code or behavior
- Follow secure coding practices

## 🔍 What We Monitor

### Automated Detection:
- **File deletions**: Large-scale file removals are flagged
- **Dependency changes**: New or modified dependencies are reviewed
- **Permission changes**: File permission modifications are tracked
- **Binary files**: Binary additions are scrutinized
- **External calls**: Network requests to external services

### Manual Review Focus:
- Changes to security-related code
- Modifications to validation logic
- Updates to authentication/authorization
- Changes to data handling
- Modifications to build or deploy scripts

## ⚠️ Suspicious Activity Indicators

The following patterns may indicate malicious intent:

### High Risk:
- Deleting multiple core files
- Adding obfuscated or minified code
- Modifying security validations
- Adding suspicious dependencies
- Changing GitHub Actions workflows
- Attempting to modify CODEOWNERS

### Medium Risk:
- Large binary file additions
- Extensive permission changes
- Adding external scripts
- Modifying build processes
- Changing test configurations

### Automatic Rejection:
- PRs that delete >30% of codebase
- PRs with detected malware patterns
- PRs with known vulnerable dependencies
- PRs attempting to bypass protections
