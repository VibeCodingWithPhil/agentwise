# Requirements Planning System

AI-powered project specification and planning from a simple idea.

## Overview

The Requirements Planning System transforms a simple project idea into comprehensive specifications, visual documentation, and actionable tasks. It uses advanced AI to analyze requirements, recommend technologies, estimate timelines, and distribute work to specialized agents.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Generate requirements from idea
/requirements "social media app for developers"

# Enhance existing requirements
/requirements-enhance

# Create visual HTML specification
/requirements-visualize

# Convert to actionable tasks
/requirements-to-tasks
```

## How It Works

### 1. AI Analysis
Advanced AI analyzes your project idea and identifies:
- Core features and functionality
- User stories and use cases
- Technical requirements
- Infrastructure needs
- Security considerations

### 2. Tech Stack Selection
Automatically recommends optimal technologies based on:
- Project requirements
- Industry best practices
- Performance needs
- Scalability requirements
- Team expertise

### 3. Timeline & Resources
Estimates development timeline and required resources:
- Phase-based development plan
- Team structure recommendations
- Milestone definitions
- Risk assessment
- Dependency mapping

## Generated Documentation

### Comprehensive Feature List
- Core features with descriptions
- Optional features and enhancements
- User stories for each feature
- Acceptance criteria
- Priority scoring

### Technical Specifications
- System architecture
- Database schema
- API endpoints
- Authentication flow
- Security requirements

### Visual Specifications
- Interactive HTML/CSS documentation
- Wireframes and mockups
- Component hierarchy
- User flow diagrams
- Served on local web server (http://localhost:3002)

## Planning Capabilities

- **Timeline Estimation**: Realistic project timelines based on complexity
- **Team Structure**: Recommended team composition and roles
- **Phase Planning**: Breaking project into manageable phases
- **Priority Scoring**: Feature prioritization based on value/effort
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifying potential challenges
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understanding feature dependencies
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimal agent and resource distribution
- **Milestone Tracking**: Clear deliverables and checkpoints

## Automatic Task Distribution

Requirements are automatically converted into tasks and assigned to agents:

### Task Generation
- Break down features into specific tasks
- Assign complexity scores
- Define acceptance criteria
- Set dependencies

### Agent Assignment
- Match tasks to agent expertise
- Balance workload across agents
- Optimize for parallel execution
- Ensure skill alignment

### Phase Organization
- Group tasks into logical phases
- Define phase dependencies
- Set phase milestones
- Track phase completion

## Example Output

```bash
$ /requirements "task management app with team collaboration"
