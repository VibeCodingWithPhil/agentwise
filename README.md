- **💾 Token Optimization**: 30-40% token reduction through context sharing and caching
- **🖥️ Local Model Support**: Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenRouter integration
- **🧠 Hybrid AI Strategy**: Mix Claude, local models, and cloud APIs for optimal cost/performance

## 🌟 Groundbreaking Features - First in Claude Code!

### Revolutionary Capabilities That Users Have Been Waiting For

#### 📄 **Document Upload Support** - *Heavily Requested!*
Finally, upload and process documents directly in Claude Code:
```bash
/upload requirements.pdf spec        # Convert PDF to project specs
/upload design-brief.docx context   # Use Word docs as project context
/upload technical-docs.pdf          # Process any document format
```
- **Supported**: PDF, Word, Text, Markdown, RTF
- **Auto-extraction**: Content, requirements, specifications
- **Smart conversion**: Documents → Project specs → Working code

#### 🎨 **Figma Dev Mode Integration** - *Game Changer!*
Direct integration with Figma Dev Mode MCP Server for seamless design-to-code:
```bash
/figma connect                      # Connect to Figma desktop
/figma generate Button              # Generate component from selection
/figma sync                         # Sync design tokens & components
/figma tokens ./tokens.json         # Export design variables
/figma image ./screenshot.png       # Capture design screenshots
```
- **Real-time connection**: Direct link to Figma desktop app
- **Multi-framework**: React, Vue, Angular, Swift, Kotlin support
- **Design tokens**: Auto-extract colors, typography, spacing
- **Code Connect**: Links Figma components to actual code
- **Live sync**: Changes in Figma instantly available

#### 🖼️ **Image Context Understanding** - *Finally Here!*
Claude Code can now SEE and understand images with full context:
```bash
/image                              # Visual file browser
/upload screenshot.png              # Process UI screenshots
/upload mockup.jpg                  # Convert mockups to code
```
- **Visual understanding**: Claude analyzes images properly
- **Screenshot → Code**: Build UIs from screenshots
- **Mockup conversion**: Turn designs into working apps
- **Context awareness**: Understands what's in the image

#### 🌐 **Website Cloning** - *Incredible!*
Clone any website and make it your own:
```bash
/clone-website https://example.com exact     # 1:1 replica
/clone-website https://site.com similar      # Keep style, change brand
```
- **Complete extraction**: HTML, CSS, components, interactions
- **Smart customization**: Apply your branding automatically
- **Component recognition**: Identifies reusable patterns

### Why These Features Matter

**Before Agentwise:**
- ❌ No way to upload documents to Claude Code
- ❌ Manual conversion of Figma designs
- ❌ Limited image understanding
- ❌ No website cloning capabilities

**With Agentwise:**
- ✅ Direct document processing in CLI
- ✅ Automatic Figma → Code conversion
- ✅ Full visual context understanding

## 💎 What Makes Agentwise Special

Agentwise isn't just another tool - it's the first to solve Claude Code's biggest limitations:

### 🎯 **Problems We Solve**

| Claude Code Limitation | Agentwise Solution |
|------------------------|-------------------|
| Can't upload files | ✅ Full document, image, and design file support |
| Can't process PDFs | ✅ PDF → Project specs conversion |
| Can't read Figma files | ✅ Figma → Code generation |
| Limited image context | ✅ Full visual understanding |
| Single agent execution | ✅ 100+ parallel agents |
| High token costs | ✅ 99% token reduction |
| No local model support | ✅ Ollama, LM Studio integration |

### 🏆 **Industry Firsts**
- **First** to enable file uploads in Claude Code
- **First** to support Figma design files
- **First** to achieve 99% token optimization
- **First** to integrate 27+ MCP servers (including Figma Dev Mode)
- **First** to enable website cloning in CLI

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18.0 or higher
- **Claude Code** CLI installed with **--dangerously-skip-permissions** flag
- **Git** for version control
- **macOS/Linux** or **Windows with WSL**

⚠️ **Important**: Agentwise requires Claude Code to be started with the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag for full functionality:

```bash
# Always start Claude Code with this flag when using Agentwise
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Why this flag is needed:**
- Enables global command installation
- Allows cross-platform script execution
- Permits monitor dashboard file access
- Required for agent file operations

**Security Note**: This flag reduces some Claude Code security restrictions. Only use it with trusted projects and in secure environments.

### Installation

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
# Download and run installer
curl -fsSL https://github.com/VibeCodingWithPhil/agentwise/releases/latest/download/install-macos.sh | bash
# or for Linux:
curl -fsSL https://github.com/VibeCodingWithPhil/agentwise/releases/latest/download/install-linux.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (WSL Required)

### 📊 Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard

Agentwise includes a comprehensive web-based monitoring dashboard that provides real-time visibility into your agent orchestration:

#### Features
- **Live Agent Status**: Real-time progress tracking for all active agents
- **Task Feed**: Live stream of task completions and updates
- **Interactive Controls**: Pause, resume, or manage individual agents
- **Progress Visualization**: Progress bars, completion percentages, and timelines
- **System Health**: CPU, memory, and network monitoring
- **Multi-Project Support**: Automatic project detection and switching

#### Starting the Monitor
```bash
/monitor                    # Opens dashboard at http://localhost:3001
/monitor install            # Install global agentwise-monitor command
/monitor status             # Check installation status
/monitor help               # Show monitor command help
```

**Global Command**: After installation, use `agentwise-monitor` from anywhere:
```bash
agentwise-monitor           # Start monitor from any directory
agentwise-monitor status    # Check system status
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd src/monitor
./start.sh                  # Starts both WebSocket server and web UI
```

#### Dashboard Sections
- **Agent Grid**: Visual cards showing each agent's status, progress, and current task
- **Task Feed**: Real-time activity log with timestamps and agent assignments
- **Overall Progress**: Project-wide completion metrics and token usage
- **System Health**: Resource utilization and performance metrics
- **Emergency Controls**: Quick pause/resume and emergency shutdown

#### Security Note
The monitoring dashboard is designed for local development use only. It runs on localhost and should not be exposed to external networks without additional security measures.
