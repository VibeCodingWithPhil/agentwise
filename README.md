## 🎯 Overview

Agentwise is a comprehensive development platform that transforms project creation through intelligent automation. Built as an extension for Claude Code, it provides complete end-to-end project setup including requirements planning, database integration, GitHub configuration, and automated security protection.

### Why Agentwise?

- **🚄 Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents work simultaneously on different aspects of projects
- **🎭 Self-Improving Agents**: Agents learn and improve from every task (VERIFIED ✅)
- **🔄 Smart Orchestration**: Intelligent task distribution and phase management
- **📊 Real-time Monitoring**: Track progress across all agents with live dashboard
- **🏗️ Smart Model Routing**: Automatic model selection based on task type
- **💾 Context Management**: Organized project context and task coordination
- **🖥️ Local Model Support**: Ollama, LM Studio, and OpenRouter integration
- **🧠 Hybrid AI Strategy**: Mix Claude, local models, and cloud APIs for optimal cost/performance
- **🔐 No --dangerously-skip-permissions Required**: Sandboxed execution with automatic permission handling

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🔐 Sandboxed Execution (No --dangerously-skip-permissions Needed!)

Agentwise now operates **without requiring the dangerous permissions flag**:

#### Automatic Permission Handling
```bash
# Before: Required dangerous flag
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions /create my-app

# Now: Works without the flag!
claude /create my-app
```

#### How It Works
- **Terminal Monitoring**: Detects permission prompts automatically
- **Smart Responses**: Responds based on your configuration
- **Workspace Sandboxing**: Restricts execution to safe directories
- **Safety Modes**: Prevents dangerous operations in production

#### Configuration
```bash
/configure-agentwise              # Interactive setup wizard
/configure-agentwise permissions  # Configure permission handling
/configure-agentwise workspace    # Set sandbox boundaries
```

### Enhanced Claude Code Capabilities

#### 📄 **Document Upload Support**
Upload and process documents directly in Claude Code:
```bash
/upload requirements.pdf spec        # Convert PDF to project specs
/upload design-brief.docx context   # Use Word docs as project context
/upload technical-docs.pdf          # Process any document format
```
- **Supported**: PDF, Word, Text, Markdown, RTF
- **Auto-extraction**: Content, requirements, specifications
- **Smart conversion**: Documents → Project specs → Working code

#### 🎨 **Figma Dev Mode Integration**
Direct integration with Figma Dev Mode MCP Server for seamless design-to-code:
```bash
/figma connect                      # Connect to Figma desktop
/figma generate Button              # Generate component from selection
/figma sync                         # Sync design tokens & components
/figma tokens ./tokens.json         # Export design variables
/figma image ./screenshot.png       # Capture design screenshots
```
- **Real-time connection**: Direct link to Figma desktop app
- **Multi-framework**: React, Vue, Angular, Swift, Kotlin support
- **Design tokens**: Auto-extract colors, typography, spacing
- **Code Connect**: Links Figma components to actual code
- **Live sync**: Changes in Figma instantly available

#### 🖼️ **Image Context Understanding**
Enhanced image processing and visual context understanding:
```bash
/image                              # Visual file browser
/upload screenshot.png              # Process UI screenshots
/upload mockup.jpg                  # Convert mockups to code
```
- **Visual understanding**: Claude analyzes images properly
- **Screenshot → Code**: Build UIs from screenshots
- **Mockup conversion**: Turn designs into working apps
- **Context awareness**: Understands what's in the image

#### 🌐 **Website Cloning**
Clone and customize websites with AI assistance:
```bash
/clone-website https://example.com exact     # 1:1 replica
/clone-website https://site.com similar      # Keep style, change brand
```
- **Complete extraction**: HTML, CSS, components, interactions
- **Smart customization**: Apply your branding automatically
- **Component recognition**: Identifies reusable patterns

### Why These Features Matter

**Before Agentwise:**
- ❌ No way to upload documents to Claude Code
- ❌ Manual conversion of Figma designs
- ❌ Limited image understanding
- ❌ No website cloning capabilities

**With Agentwise:**
- ✅ Direct document processing in CLI
- ✅ Automatic Figma → Code conversion
- ✅ Full visual context understanding
- ✅ Website replication and customization

These features extend Claude Code's capabilities for more comprehensive development workflows.

## 🆕 Enhanced Context Management

Agentwise implements a dual-context system for better project organization:

### 📋 AGENTS.md (Context 2.0)
Based on [OpenAI's AGENTS.md specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/AGENTS.md), this provides a universal interface for AI tools:
- **Universal Compatibility**: Any AI CLI can understand your project
- **Human-Readable**: Clear guidance for both humans and AI
- **Standardized Format**: Following OpenAI's open specification
- **Project Guidelines**: Setup, testing, architecture, conventions

### 🧠 CodebaseContextManager (Context 3.0)
Our proprietary real-time context awareness system:
- **Dynamic Understanding**: Tracks your entire codebase
- **Real-Time Updates**: File changes tracked automatically
- **Deep Analysis**: Extracts imports, exports, classes, functions
- **Smart Updates**: Only refreshes changed portions
- **Hierarchical Understanding**: Maintains project structure relationships

### How They Work Together
```
AGENTS.md → Universal AI Interface (any tool can read)
     +
CodebaseContextManager → Deep, Real-Time Understanding (Agentwise exclusive)
     =
Comprehensive Context System: Universal compatibility + deep awareness
```

**Note**: Our approach combines universal compatibility (AGENTS.md) with real-time codebase understanding, making it particularly well-suited for multi-agent workflows.

### 📊 Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard with Observable Visualizations

Agentwise includes a comprehensive web-based monitoring dashboard that provides real-time visibility into your agent orchestration:

#### Features
- **Live Agent Status**: Real-time progress tracking for all active agents
- **Task Feed**: Live stream of task completions and updates
- **Interactive Controls**: Pause, resume, or manage individual agents
- **Progress Visualization**: Progress bars, completion percentages, and timelines
- **System Health**: CPU, memory, and network monitoring
- **Multi-Project Support**: Automatic project detection and switching

- **Token Optimization Metrics**: Real-time charts showing 99.3% reduction

#### Starting the Monitor
```bash
/monitor                    # Opens dashboard (auto-installs global command)
/monitor install            # Manually install global command
/monitor global             # Alternative install command  
/monitor status             # Check installation status
/monitor help               # Show monitor command help
```

**Note**: Running `/monitor` without subcommands now automatically installs the global command if not present.

**Global Command**: After installation, use `agentwise-monitor` from anywhere:
```bash
agentwise-monitor           # Start monitor from any directory
agentwise-monitor status    # Check system status
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd src/monitor
./start.sh                  # Starts both WebSocket server and web UI
```

#### Dashboard Sections
- **Agent Grid**: Visual cards showing each agent's status, progress, and current task
- **Task Feed**: Real-time activity log with timestamps and agent assignments
- **Overall Progress**: Project-wide completion metrics and token usage
- **System Health**: Resource utilization and performance metrics
- **Emergency Controls**: Quick pause/resume and emergency shutdown

#### Security Note
The monitoring dashboard is designed for local development use only. It runs on localhost and should not be exposed to external networks without additional security measures.

### How MCP Integration Works

1. **Automatic Assignment**: Each agent gets relevant MCPs based on their specialization
2. **Dynamic Loading**: MCPs are loaded only when needed to optimize performance
3. **Seamless Integration**: Agents can directly use MCP tools without additional configuration
4. **Cross-Agent Sharing**: MCPs can be shared between agents for collaborative tasks

### Example MCP Usage

```bash
# Frontend agent uses Figma MCP
/figma generate Button      # Extracts button from Figma

# Database agent uses PostgreSQL MCP
# Automatically optimizes queries and suggests indexes

# Testing agent uses Playwright MCP
# Generates and runs E2E tests automatically
```
